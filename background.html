  <h1>My Background</h1>
  <p>It's been a long and winding road to get me here in coding bootcamp.  Below I list out some of my history that brought me here.</p>

    <h4>University of Kentucky</h4>
    <p class="background-info">I graduated in 2009 from the University of Kentucky with a bachelor's degree in Hospitality Management & Tourism.  While I haven't used the degree much, I had a great time, learned a lot, and met some lifelong friends.

    <h4>Yellowstone</h4>
    <p class="background-info">After graduating I spent a few years working seasonal jobs at national parks and ski resorts.  Yellowstone was my first destination and really opened my eyes to the opportunities seasonal work provides and to our amazing national park system!

    <h4>Sabio</h4>
    <p class="background-info">After traveling around a bit I settled into a job managing a fine dining restaurant in Lexington KY called Sabio.  Here I really learned the value of hard work and polished up my bartending skills.

    <h4>Photography</h4>
    <p class="background-info">A few years later I moved to Portland and started dating a photographer.  She became a mentor of sorts and helped get my foot into the professional photography world.  I found I don't love the hustle of running a photography business, but my passion for the hobby remains. (We are no longer together)

    <h4>Epicodus!</h4>
    <p class="background-info">And now we arrive at present! I'm currently attending Epicodus and learning some really amazing coding skills.  I'm incredibly excited to learn how to program and to see where this path takes me.
